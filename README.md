# Algorithms ðŸ§®
A repo to store my work through the Makers Academy algorithms module, consisting of:

 - A basic Ruby program to test the speed of Algorithms at different levels of complexity using randomly generated arrays of numbers.
 - My own implementation of some algorithmic classics.
 - A [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mg60WMZegYgfOah6CJK0uerEUDJKBzaRN8rFbeOuWW8/edit?usp=sharing) tracking speeds in milliseconds of Ruby's built in algorithms and my own implementations.

To run any algorithm that uses arrays, change #function_to_test in my timer template at ./lib/codetimer.rb.

My own implementations benchmarked with this template will be found in ./algorithms
